# Role-Based Authentication and Authorization in Blazor Application with Microsoft Identity Core

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement **role-based authentication and authorization** in a **Blazor WebAssembly** or **Blazor Server** application using **Microsoft Identity Core**. It leverages **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user authentication, and access to specific components and pages is controlled based on user roles. This allows for fine-grained control over who can access what within your Blazor application.

## Features
- Role-based authentication and authorization in Blazor
- Secure login, registration, and role management pages
- Role-based access control using `AuthorizeView` and `Roles` in Blazor components
- Easy setup with Entity Framework Core for managing users and roles

## Tech Stack
- **Blazor WebAssembly** or **Blazor Server**
- **Microsoft Identity Core** (for authentication and roles)
- **Entity Framework Core** (for database integration)
- **SQL Server** (or any supported database)
- **C#** and **ASP.NET Core** (for backend logic)

## Pre-Requisites

Before you can run this application, ensure you have the following:
- .NET SDK 6.0 or above
- SQL Server (or another database of your choice)
- Visual Studio or any preferred code editor
- Blazor WebAssembly or Blazor Server setup

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blazor-role-based-authentication-ms-identity-core.git
